K27 - Basic functions in JavaScript
2025-01-06m

Q/C/C: 
- To link a JavaScript file to the HTML file, put the <script> tag in the HTML file.
- It seems like we can’t test javascript functions on python. Is that why we need to test the functions in the console?
- The results of the functions, written in the javascript file, aren’t automatically displayed on developer browser.
